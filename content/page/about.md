My name is Jenna Allen and I am an aspiring data scientist. I love thinking creatively and using the statistical programming language R to find actionable insights. In addition to analyzing and visualizing data in R, I find it particularly satisfying to use it to automate manual tasks such as reporting. I want to use my analytic skills for good, and I am on a quest to find an organization that will pay me to do meaningful and socially impactful work.

I have an undergraduate degree in biochemistry and worked in the biotech field for the first several years of my career. After deciding that biotech wasn't my jam, I went back to school and earned a Masters of Business Administration with a concentration in Business Analytics. In grad school, I made the leap from scientist to data analyst and I haven't looked back. 

A year and a half ago, my husband and I sold our house and most of our things to hit the road in a 28 foot travel trailer. You can usually find me somewhere in the western U.S. living and working from scenic destinations with good cell signal.
