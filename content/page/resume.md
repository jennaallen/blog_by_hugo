<center> <h3>Professional Profile </h3> </center>

I am a data analyst who loves using my programming skills to creatively solve problems. I have a natural ability to ask good questions and challenge the way things have been done in an effort to enhance the end result. I am known for my ability to jump in and dig into things that have a high degree of unknowns. I have expertise in developing new processes and improving existing processes with the objective of maximizing efficiency and cost effectiveness. I am forever curious, thorough, and I learn complicated subject material quickly. I think critically, and I have proven writing and data storytelling abilities. I thrive in both independent and collaborative environments and can communicate complex ideas simply. Learning is my jam and I am known for my laid back attitude, willingness to ask questions, receive feedback, and do more than my fair share.
